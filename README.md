# Predicting-Admission
**In this project:**
- We will create a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).
- By analyzing the parameters in this graduate admissions dataset, we will use TensorFlow with Keras to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted.
